# titanic is avaliable in your workspace
# 1 - Check the structure of titanic to determine what data
#and data types (int, char, etc) are in the dataset.

str(titanic)

# 2 - Use ggplot() for the first instruction, pulling from the Titanic data set

ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Pclass, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")



# 3 - Plot 2, add facet_grid() layer
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Pclass, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + facet_grid(. ~Survived)



# 4 - Define an object for position jitterdodge, to use below
posn.jd <- position_jitterdodge(0.5, 0, 0.6)


# 5 - Plot 3, but use the position object from instruction 4
#Adding the "alpha" component creates a certain transluence of the data points based on the value of alpha.
#The size of each point (3) based on the internal R size database.

ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Pclass, y = Age, color = Sex)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5, position = posn.jd) + facet_grid(. ~Survived)
